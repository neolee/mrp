[Not working gems]
mysql 2.7: install error when compiling native extension
mysqlplus 0.1.0: installed and runnable, but some I/O error resulting char glitch (not very clear issue)
mislav-will_paginate: installed and raise errors

[Hacking]
'load_rubygems' in config/boot.rb should be commented out, which is totally not needed in Ruby 1.9
